For communication we will do discord and google hangouts, which will allow us to use our UB emails. We are going to 
resolve our potential disagreements by doing rock paper scissors and having group discussions. We can help set expectations 
by communicating on discord and by trying to do things unanimously. We can also break down problems into smaller parts and 
be present in actually looking over each otherâ€™s work.
