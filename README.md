**CSE 370 - 
Designing a Social Media App**


**Project Description:**
Bubble is a location-based social media product that allows the users to venture into other places from any location in the world. Want to find out what’s going on nearby? Excited to meet new people with similar/not similar interests? Hungry and not sure where to eat? Bubble comes to the rescue with an all-in-one application that will act as your social hub. Bubble will be available for the Web and Mobile Platforms - iOS & Android. 

**Demographic:**
Gearing our product towards people willing to make new friends and explore new places.

**Problems to be solve:**
In our technology obsessed age, many people of the millennial and gen-Z populations are often accused of becoming less social, of being too absorbed by their technology. Our app, however, is a technology geared towards this age group that serves as a facilitator of social interaction. It is true that sometimes we do not know what or whom is right outside our very door, but with Bubble, the fear one must overcome to combat one’s social anxiety only to realize that you have nothing in common, will be completely superseded by the app that opens new doors to new friendships.

**User Stories:**

As a user who wants their voice heard, I want to know what other people are talking about, so I can share my thoughts with the others.

As someone new to the platform, I want to have some sort of introduction for the platform, so I can get an idea on how to use it.

As someone who likes to set up events, I want to be able to set up events for friends to meet up, so we can all have an idea where to hang out.

As a reviewer, I would like to recommend places to other people, so they can try out new places.

As an explorer, I want to be able to save the places I have gone, so I can revisit them when I am home.

As someone looking for new friends, I want to be able to look for other people with similar interests, so I can reach out to them.

As someone new to the social media scene, I want to be able to customize my search preferences for new people to meet, so I can stay within my comfort zone in terms of age and distance.

As a photographer, I want to post pictures with the location of where the picture was taken so that other users can know where to find cool places in the world.

As a club owner, I want my photos to appear on other users’ feeds in real time so that these users can decide to go to a party the same night.

As someone without location services on my phone or computer, I want to be able to set my location so that I can still enjoy seeing what is going on in my area.
